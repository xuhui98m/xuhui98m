I am a fourth year PhD student in [Department of Management Science and Engineering](https://msande.stanford.edu) at Stanford University. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jose Blanchet](https://web.stanford.edu/~jblanche). I am a member of the [Operations Research group](https://or.stanford.edu), and the [Advanced Financial Technologies Laboratory](https://fintech.stanford.edu). Prior to Stanford, I completed my undergraduate in Mathematics from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn).
